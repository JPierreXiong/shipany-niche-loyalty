    "title": "The Narrative",
    "paragraph1": "At Glow, we believe that software should be as beautiful as the products you create. Most loyalty platforms are built for corporations—cluttered with complex dashboards and intrusive pop-ups that distract from your brand's soul.",
    "paragraph2": "We built Glow for the independent artisan. By leveraging a high-performance stack—Next.js, Neon, and Vercel—we offer a \"quiet\" technology that stays in the background, allowing your craftsmanship to shine.",
    "paragraph3": "Our mission is simple: help makers build deeper connections with their communities through elegant, distraction-free loyalty experiences."
