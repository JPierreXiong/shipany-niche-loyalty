**Last Updated: February 6, 2026**

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to **Glow** (accessible via the Service). Glow is a digital loyalty platform designed specifically for Shopify artisans. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use our service.

## 2. Eligibility and Shopify Integration

To use Glow, you must maintain an active Shopify store in good standing. Glow operates as a third-party integration; therefore, your use of our service is also subject to Shopify's API Terms and Acceptable Use Policies.

## 3. The "Digital Heirloom" License

Upon subscribing to a Glow plan, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to create and distribute digital membership cards (Digital Heirlooms) to your customers. You retain all intellectual property rights to your brand assets (Logos, Colors, Fonts) uploaded to our platform.

## 4. Subscription Tiers and Billing

We operate on a subscription model with the following tiers:

- **Seed (Free):** Limited to 50 members
- **Base ($19.90/month):** Limited to 250 members with full brand customization
- **Pro ($59.90/month):** Unlimited members and advanced automation

All payments are processed securely via **Creem**. Fees are non-refundable unless otherwise stated by local consumer law.

## 5. User Accounts and Responsibilities

To access features like campaign management and member analytics, you must create an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and all activities that occur under your account.

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

Users may not use Glow to:

- Distribute spam, fraudulent rewards, or misleading content
- Violate intellectual property rights
- Engage in activities that harm the Glow community standard
- Attempt to reverse engineer or compromise our platform security

We reserve the right to terminate accounts that violate these terms.

## 7. Service Availability and Technical Dependencies

Glow is built on high-performance technologies including **Next.js, Neon, and Vercel**. While we strive for maximum uptime, we do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free. We rely on third-party services including **Shopify, Apple Wallet, Google Pay, Resend,** and **Twilio**, and are not responsible for outages or policy changes initiated by these external providers.

## 8. Privacy and Data Collection

We collect minimal data necessary for service operation: email addresses, store information, and member engagement metrics. We are committed to protecting your privacy. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for detailed information about data handling.

## 9. Intellectual Property

All platform software, UI design, and the "Glow" brand remain the property of Glow. You retain ownership of all content, brand assets, and customer data you upload to the platform. We claim no ownership over your business information or member data.

## 10. Refund Policy

Subscription fees are generally non-refundable once the billing period has started. However, if a service failure occurs due to internal system errors, a credit or partial refund may be issued at our discretion. For billing disputes, contact us at support@glow.app within 14 days.

## 11. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Glow shall not be liable for:

- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
- Loss of revenue or business opportunities
- Service interruptions caused by third-party providers
- User errors in campaign setup or member management

The service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

## 12. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. We will notify users of material changes via email or platform notification. Continued use of the service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.

## 13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws. Any disputes shall be resolved through good faith negotiation or, if necessary, through binding arbitration.

## 14. Contact Information
